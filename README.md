<h3>Search the Data Dictionary</h3>

Find information about a project's data dictionary in one easy to use location.  
Searching is client side making this a lightweight E.M. 

<h4>Consolidate code book information.</h4>
<em>Example:</em>  get a short report on every variable that uses a date format "DMY". 

Search a single category like Field Name or search multiple categories at the same time.
<em>Example:</em> search Field Name, Field Label and Field Note at the same time.

Categories that can be search are the column headers in the data dictionary CSV file.

<h4>Limit results to a single or multiple field types.</h4>  
<em>Example:</em> Search for all note field variables with "_specify" in the variable name or label.

<h4>Text specificity</h4> 
can be set to match either the exact phrase or a part of the phrase.
<em>Example:</em> Use Partial Match to search varialbes with the word "amount" in the variable name and the results returned could include "Payment Amount", "Rent Amount", "Drug Amount" and "Amount of liquid."

<h4>Case Sensitivity</h4>
pertains to whether or not the case is strict or not.
<em>Example:</em> Search for all select choices that have "0=NO" instead of "0=no".
<em>Example:</em> Ignore the case and get both "0=No" and "0=no" in select choices.

<h4>Display Results in a condensed format.</h4>
Code books contain more than what you're looking for. TMI!
<em>Example:</em> use "Display selected only" to display only the Field Name, Label, and Field Type of 15 variables.

<h4>Select an Instrument:</h4>
Display all variables in an instrument or choose a single variable from that instrument.

<h4>Select a Field:</h4>
Choose one field from the select instrument to display.
