<h3>Search the Data Dictionary</h3>

<p>Find information about a project's data dictionary in one easy to use location.  
Searching is client side making this a lightweight E.M.</p> 

<h4>Consolidate code book information.</h4>
<p><em>Example:</em>  get a short report on every variable that uses a date format "DMY".</p> 

<p>Search a single category like Field Name or search multiple categories at the same time.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> search Field Name, Field Label and Field Note at the same time.</p>

<p>Categories that can be search are the column headers in the data dictionary CSV file.</p>

<h4>Limit results to a single or multiple field types.</h4>  
<p><em>Example:</em> Search for all note field variables with "_specify" in the variable name or label.</p>

<h4>Text specificity</h4>

<p><em>Example:</em> Use Partial Match to search variables with the word "amount" in the variable name and the results returned could include "Payment Amount", "Rent Amount", "Drug Amount" and "Amount of liquid."</p>

<h4>Case Sensitivity</h4>
pertains to whether or not the case is strict or not.
<p><em>Example:</em> Search for all select choices that have "0=NO" instead of "0=no".</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Ignore the case and get both "0=No" and "0=no" in select choices.</p>

<h4>Display Results in a condensed format.</h4>
<p>Code books contain more than what you're looking for. TMI!</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> use "Display selected only" to display only the Field Name, Label, and Field Type of 15 variables.</p>

<h4>Select an Instrument:</h4>
<p>Display all variables in an instrument or choose a single variable from that instrument.</p>
